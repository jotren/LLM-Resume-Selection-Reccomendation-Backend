# LLM Resume Selection Recommendation Backend

The aim of this project is to create an __application__ that can process a number of resumes (CVs), query them, and return the individuals that match specified criteria most closely. To solve this problem, I have built an API in python that can return embedding values and similarity scores for queries against the resume text. You can see that information here:

This application will serve as a backend, allowing the user to:

1) Upload pdf CVs
2) Create embeddings via an API
3) Save the data to a database
4) Allow the user to query an API to get a similarity score
